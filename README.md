Introduction: 

As new investors learn more about the world of cryptocurrency, oftentimes than not, it can be an information overload when it comes to selecting a coin to invest in. 

The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that helps investors make an educated decision on which of the selected 4 coins is a better investment based on fundamental data. For this project, we’ve selected the following four coins: BTC, ETH, DOGE and BNB. 

The total market cap for all crypto is 2.38 trillion. 

Research Questions: 

During the early planning stages, we came up with the following questions to build and set an overall foundation for the project. Taking inspiration from price-tracking websites for cryptoassests such as CoinMarketCap, we chose certain coin fundamentals and plots suitable for beginners starting out in cryptocurrency. 

How often should the coin data be refreshed (including USD exchange rates)?
How coin fundamentals have changed over time (market cap, volume or supply, etc.)? 
Should we display a coin’s realistic market cap numbers as well? How detailed will this project be? How will it be organized? 
Is it useful to show a coin’s market cap rank, liquidity score, and all time highs/lows? 
Can fundamental analysis help investors make better investment decisions?

Data Collection:

We will be using CoinMetrics APIs to fetch the information for supply for this project. Coin Metrics organizes the world's crypto data and makes it transparent and accessible. 
The data points we will highlight include: market cap, volume, circulating supply, total supply, active addresses, and other relevant information. We will set up Jupyter Notebook to look like a dashboard and will use pandas for data frames to display the information provided by the API. 

BTC:
With a total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin, as of August 2021 the highest valued coin with 18 million coins currently circulating. Once the 21 million coins are mined there will be no more available. With 18 million coins multiplied by its current price ($45K-  August 11, 2021) puts Bitcoins’ market cap of over a trillion dollars.
